Configuring
===========

Each segment is made up of 6 parts. **Output handler**, **output generator**, **generator arguments**, **color**, **conditions**, **condition arguments**. Having a color such as "#FF0000,#FFFFFF" will flash between the two.

**Output handlers**
-------------------

These handle how the generated content is displayed. Valid ones are: string, bar, percent and timeconv. Pretty self-explanatory.
